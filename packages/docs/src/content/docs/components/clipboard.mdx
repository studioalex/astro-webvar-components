import  { Clipboard, Button } from 'astro-webvar-components';

The **`Clipboard`** component is a customizable and user-friendly solution for copying text to
the clipboard within your web applications. Designed as a custom HTML element (`<clipboard></clipboard>`),
this component simplifies the process of creating a button that copies specified text to the 
clipboard when clicked. It provides visual feedback to the user by temporarily changing the button's 
text to "Copied!" before reverting back to its original content.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: The component is designed to be easily integrated into your web application as a custom HTML element.
- **Visual Feedback**: It provides visual feedback to the user by changing the button's text to "Copied!" for a brief period.
- **Accessibility**: The component is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it can be easily used by a wide range of users.

## Usage

To use the `Clipboard` component, include it in your HTML and place a `<button>` element with a `data-copy` 
attribute inside the component. Here's a basic example:

```astro
<Clipboard>
	<button data-copy="Text to copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>
</Clipboard>
```

This example creates a button that, when clicked, copies the text "Text to copy" to the clipboard and 
displays "Copied!" for 1 second before reverting to its original text.

## Example

<div class="mt-20 mb-8">
    <Clipboard>
        <Button data-copy="https://example.com">Copy Link</Button>
    </Clipboard>
</div>

```astro
<Clipboard>
	<Button data-copy="https://example.com">Copy Link</Button>
</Clipboard>
```

This example creates a button that, when clicked, copies the URL "https://example.com" 
to the clipboard and displays "Copied!" for 1 second before reverting to its original text.

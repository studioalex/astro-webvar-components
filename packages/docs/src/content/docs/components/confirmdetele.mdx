import { ConfirmDelete, Button, LinkButton } from 'astro-webvar-components';

The `ConfirmDelete` component is a customizable and secure solution for implementing
delete actions within your web applications. Designed specifically for use in a horizontal 
button bar, this component ensures that users must intentionally confirm a delete 
action by moving their mouse to the left side, thereby reducing the risk of accidental deletions.

## Features

- **Secure Confirmation**: The component requires users to confirm their intention to delete by 
  interacting with a separate confirmation button, enhancing the security of delete actions.
- **Accessibility**: The component is designed with accessibility in mind, using ARIA attributes 
  to improve screen reader support.
- **Customizable**: The component supports customization through the `endpoint` prop, allowing 
  developers to specify the URL for the delete action.

## Usage

To use the `ConfirmDelete` component, include it in your Astro JS Pages and provide the `endpoint` attribute. Here's a basic example:

```astro
<ConfirmDelete endpoint="/blog/delete/slug" />
```
This example creates a delete button that, when clicked, reveals a confirmation bar with a cancel and
confirm button. The `endpoint` prop specifies the URL for the delete action.

## Properties

| Property  | Type     | Description                                                                |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| endpoint  | string   | The URL that the delete action will navigate to. This is a required prop.  |

## Example

<div class="no-margin relative flex flex-row items-center justify-between gap-8 my-8 flex-nowrap">
    <div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-4 flex-nowrap">
        <Button
            type="submit"
            class="justify-center min-w-44"
            variant="dark"
            aria-label="Save article">
            Save
        </Button>
        <LinkButton
            href="/components/confirmdetele"
            variant="dark-outline"
            class="justify-center min-w-44"
            aria-label="Cancel article editing"
            style="color: black;">
            Cancel
        </LinkButton>
    </div>
    <ConfirmDelete endpoint="/components/confirmdetele" />
</div>

```astro
<ConfirmDelete endpoint="/delete-article/123" />
```

This example creates a delete button for an article with an ID of 123. When clicked, it reveals a 
confirmation bar with a cancel and confirm button. The endpoint prop specifies the URL for the 
delete action, including the article ID.

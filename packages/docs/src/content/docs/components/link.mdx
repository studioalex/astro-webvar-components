The Link Component is a lightweight, customizable solution for embedding hyperlinks
within text or paragraph content in Astro JS Pages. Unlike traditional navigation links,
this component is designed to enhance the readability and interactivity of text, making
it an ideal choice for adding contextual links within your content.

## Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: The component supports custom CSS classes through the `class` property,
  allowing for a wide range of styling options. By default, it applies a shadow effect and changes the
  text color on hover, enhancing the visual appeal and user interaction.
- **Flexible Integration**: Built with Astro, this component is designed to seamlessly integrate with your
  Astro JS Pages. It leverages the power of TypeScript and JSX, making it easy to include in your projects.
- **Accessibility and Usability**: The component is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring that the
  links are easily accessible and usable across different devices and browsers.

## Usage

To use the Link Component, simply include it in your Astro JS Pages and provide the `href` attribute with the
desired URL. You can also add custom CSS classes through the `class` property to further customize the
appearance of the link.

## Props

Has the same props as the HTML `a` tag.

## Example

<div class="mt-20 mb-8">
  <Link href="/components/link" class="custom-class">
    About
  </Link>
</div>

```astro
<Link href="/about" class="custom-class">About</Link>
```

This component is a powerful tool for enhancing the textual content of your Astro JS Pages, providing a simple yet effective way to add contextual links without the complexity of traditional navigation systems.

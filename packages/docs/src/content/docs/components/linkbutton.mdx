The LinkButton Component is a versatile and customizable solution for creating links that appear as buttons,
ensuring both semantic correctness and harmonious design within your web projects.
Built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, it's designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate, making it an ideal
choice for projects where performance and flexibility are paramount.

## Features

- **Button-like Appearance**: Despite being an anchor (\<a\>) element, the LinkButton Component is styled to look like a button, providing a consistent look and feel across your application.
- **Variants**: The component supports a wide range of color variants, including primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, and dark. Each variant comes in two styles: solid and outline, offering flexibility in design.
- **Rounded Corners**: The LinkButton allows for customization of the button's rounded corners, with options ranging from none to fully rounded, ensuring it fits seamlessly into any design aesthetic.
- **Sizes**: Available in various sizes, from extra small (xs) to extra large (xl), the LinkButton can be tailored to match the context in which it's used.
- **Custom Classes**: Developers can extend the LinkButton's functionality and appearance by adding custom CSS classes through the class property.

## Usage

To use the LinkButton Component, include it in your Astro JS Pages and customize it using the available properties. Here's a basic example:

<div class="mt-20 mb-8">
    <LinkButton href="/components/linkbutton" variant="primary" size="lg" rounded="full" style="color: white;">Click Me</LinkButton>
</div>

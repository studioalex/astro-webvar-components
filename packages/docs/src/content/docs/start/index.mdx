Webvar Componets is a lightway and easy to use components library for AstroJS.
It do not use any framework like React, Vue or Svelte, it is just a simple and 
easy to use components library and require only Tailwind CSS.

## Quick Start

### Adding it to your Astro project

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    <Code code="npm install astro-webvar-components" lang="bash" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    <Code code="pnpm install astro-webvar-components" lang="bash"  />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    <Code code="yarn install astro-webvar-components" lang="bash"  />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Start using the components

After installing the `astro-webvar-components` package, you can start using the components 
in your AstroJS project. Here's a basic example of how to use a component from the library:

```astro
import { Button } from 'astro-webvar-components';

<Button variant="primary" size="lg">Click Me</Button>
```

This example imports and uses the `Button` component from the `astro-webvar-components` package.
You can replace `Button` with any other component available in the library.

### Customizing Components

Webvar Components are designed to be highly customizable. You can pass props to components 
to customize their appearance and behavior. For example, to customize a `Button` component:


```astro
import { Button } from 'astro-webvar-components';

<Button variant="danger" size="sm" class="mr-2">Delete</Button>
```

This example creates a small, danger-themed button with a margin to the right.

### Using Tailwind CSS

Since Webvar Components are styled with Tailwind CSS, you can use any Tailwind utility classes
to further customize the appearance of the components. For example:

```astro
import { Button } from 'astro-webvar-components';

<Button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"> Custom Button </Button>
```

This example creates a custom-styled button using Tailwind CSS classes.

### Conclusion

Webvar Components make it easy to add beautiful, responsive, and customizable components to your AstroJS projects. 
Whether you're building a static site, a blog, or a complex web application, Webvar Components can help you get 
started quickly and maintain a consistent design across your project.
